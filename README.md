# Usage (run fullstack app on your machine)

## Prerequisites
- [MongoDB](https://gist.github.com/nrollr/9f523ae17ecdbb50311980503409aeb3)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ^10.0.0
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

notice, you need client and server runs concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them talk to each other

## Client-Side Usage(PORT: 3000)
```terminal
$ cd client          // go to client folder
$ yarn # or npm i    // npm install packages
$ npm start        // run it locally

// deployment for client app
$ npm run build // this will compile the react code and generate a folder called build in the root level
$ npm run start // this will run the files in docs, this behavior is exactly the same how gh-pages will run your static site
```

## Server-Side Usage(PORT: 8000)

### Setting up Environemnt Variables

(You need to check and properly set JWT_KEY, JWT_SECRET and MONGO_URI in .env to connect to MongoDB and etc.)


### Import Database

```terminal
db/
   spots.json (Containing all parking locations and spots for the given test requirements.
   users.json (User account with the given user credentials)
   /bson (This folder has the same data with the bson format)
```

### Start

```terminal
$ cd api   // go to api server folder
$ npm i       // npm install packages
$ npm run server // run it locally
